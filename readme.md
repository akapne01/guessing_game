# About Rust
- Prelude is a list of things that Rust automatically imports into every Rust program. You can explore what is included in the prelude here: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/prelude/index.html.
- Prelude can be seen as a pattern to make using multiple types more convinient. You will find other preludes in the standard library. Like: `std::io::prelude`.
- Various libraries in Rust ecosystem may also define their own preludes, but they need to be imported in the code. 
- Variables are immutable by default.
